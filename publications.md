Events are points in time. The distance between any two events is a duration. These two simple definitions allow us to formulate a mathematical framework encompassing many different demographic formulations of time. Center piece of this article is APCTDL: A three dimensional coordinate system based upon the relationships between age, period, birth cohort, age until death, death coort and life-span. This is a 3D extension of the Lexis surface.

Tim drew me in so deep into his mad world that I can't really recall who did what in writing the paper. This was a wonderful collaboration.

The continuous rise of life-expectancy is a double blessing as it develops in lockstep with higher lifespan equality. This in itself is remarkable, just imagine if rising GDP would be coupled to rising economic equality... The relationship between average life-span and life-span equality for modern day humans a long known demographic fact. In this paper we extended this relationship to our ancestors: hunters and gatherers and non-human primates.

I worked on the statistics of life-span equality, some of this work can be found [here](https://github.com/jschoeley/e0lxequal). The article also inspired work on [`pash`](https://github.com/jschoeley/pash) -- an R package for pace and shape analysis of life-tables.
